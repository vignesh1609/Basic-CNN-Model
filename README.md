# Basic-CNN-Model
# Doodle Image Recognition.
For our project, we will create a model that can recognize images that were hand-drawn. Handwriting recognition has a lot of potential in real-world applications such as converting scanned images or handwritten notes into digital text, so we knew that our project would be very applicable to real-world situations. We were excited to see what challenges we would face in creating our classifier since doodles can vary much more than handwritten text.

This data was generated from an experimental game called “Quick, Draw!”, which was created to educate the public about how AI works. In this game, users are prompted to draw an image given a certain category such as “banana”. This game generated more than 1 billion doodles, and a subset of this dataset has been released on Kaggle. This subset we will be using for our project.

Our Aim of this project is to build a recognizer that can effectively learn from this very noisy data and perform well on manually-labelled test set. 

Algorithms used: CNN ,resnet50
